/**
 * Creating a worktree to spawn an agent into (issue #69).
 *
 * The counterpart to `worktree-prune.ts`: that module ends a worktree's life,
 * this one starts it. They share `worktree-git.ts` for plumbing and the same
 * placement convention, `<main>/.claude/worktrees/<name>`, which is where
 * Claude Code puts the worktrees it creates for itself. Matching it keeps the
 * whole population under one layout, so the prune scan, the picker's grouping
 * and any existing tooling see one kind of worktree rather than two.
 *
 * Naming is mechanical and always will be: a slug from an explicit name or
 * from the first words of the prompt. No model is consulted, deliberately,
 * because a branch name that varies run to run is not something a user can
 * predict, script, or find again.
 *
 * TWO DELIBERATE DIVERGENCES from what Claude Code does with its own
 * worktrees, both chosen rather than overlooked:
 *
 * 1. The branch is the BARE slug. Claude Code prefixes its own with
 *    `worktree-`. Matching it was considered and rejected: "behave
 *    identically" is worth paying for in FILE SETUP, where a difference
 *    produces a worktree that misbehaves, but a branch name is user-facing
 *    intent rather than a compatibility surface. Someone typing
 *    `--worktree fix-thing` expects a branch called `fix-thing`, and a forced
 *    prefix would clutter every branch listing to no benefit.
 * 2. No lock is taken. Claude Code holds a session lock for the life of its
 *    session, which is why `git worktree list` shows its worktrees as
 *    `locked` with a reason naming the session and pid. Not copying it is the
 *    behavior we want on both sides: ccmux's prune skips locked worktrees, so
 *    a live Claude session is protected by its own lock, and a ccmux-created
 *    worktree is protected by prune's own rules instead. Those rules are what
 *    make the absent lock safe. A worktree with a session bound to it is
 *    never offered for removal, whatever that session's status is, so a
 *    worktree spawned here is protected for as long as its agent is around.
 *    And a worktree still sitting on the tip it was cut from does not read as
 *    merged, because a branch whose tip equals a base tip is excluded from
 *    that classification, so a fresh one is not mistaken for finished work.
 *    The limit of that is worth knowing, since it is narrower than "has no
 *    commits of its own": a worktree cut from an OLDER ref (a `base` of
 *    `main~1`) sits on no base tip, so it can read as merged-locally from the
 *    moment it exists and the bound session is the only thing holding it.
 *    What a lock would add on top of all that is protection for a worktree
 *    with no session at all, which is exactly the debris the prune exists to
 *    clear.

 * behavior, so it is worth being explicit about how much each part is
 * guaranteed, because the answers differ and the undocumented ones can drift
 * with a Claude Code release:
 *
 * - DOCUMENTED: `.worktreeinclude` is gitignore syntax, it COPIES rather than
 *   symlinks, and it applies a dual filter (matches a pattern AND is
 *   gitignored). Both halves are delegated to git in
 *   {@link resolveWorktreeIncludes} rather than reimplemented.
 * - OBSERVED against the real implementation (`claude --worktree` run on a
 *   throwaway fixture, so these are its actual outputs rather than
 *   inferences) and NOT documented, so any of it can drift with a release:
 *   the placement is the same `<main>/.claude/worktrees/<name>`;
 *   `symlinkDirectories` produces an ABSOLUTE symlink into the main checkout;
 *   an entry whose source does not exist is skipped rather than failing; and
 *   a NESTED entry (`nested/cache`) was not linked at all, where this
 *   implementation does create it, having already made the parent directory.
 *   Doing slightly more there is harmless: the link points at real content
 *   the repo asked to share.
 * - CONFIRMED by experiment rather than taken on trust: `.worktreeinclude`
 *   really does leave tracked files alone. A tracked file matching an include
 *   pattern, modified in the main working copy, arrived in the new worktree
 *   with the COMMITTED content, proving git's checkout supplied it and the
 *   include pass did not copy over the top.
 * - CONSERVATIVE CHOICES where behavior could not be pinned down, each
 *   picked so the failure mode is a worktree that needs one manual step
 *   rather than one that lost something: a missing source is skipped instead
 *   of failing the spawn; an existing target is never overwritten, so a
 *   checked-out path of the same name is never replaced by a link; and every
 *   step is reported in the result so a user can see what was applied and
 *   why their worktree looks the way it does.
 *
 * Known upstream interactions worth remembering: writing to a symlinked file
 * replaces the symlink with a regular file (atomic rename), and
 * `git worktree remove` refuses to remove symlinks as untracked entries.
 * Neither breaks ccmux's own prune, which renames the directory aside and
 * calls `git worktree prune` rather than `git worktree remove`, and whose
 * recursive delete unlinks symlinks instead of following them.
 *
 * Locking is the one observed behavior deliberately not copied; see
 * divergence 2 in this file's header for why.
 *
 * Symlinks for `worktree.symlinkDirectories` (a shared `node_modules` is the
 * point: copying it would be slow and would double the disk cost of every
 * worktree), copies for `.worktreeinclude` (local settings and secrets, where
 * a symlink would silently propagate an edit in one worktree back to the main
 * checkout and every sibling).
 *
 * Every step is best-effort and reported rather than fatal. A worktree with
 * an unlinked `node_modules` still works after an install; a worktree that
 * failed to be created because a symlink could not be made is just gone.

 * Record the ref a new branch was cut from as `branch.<name>.ccmux-base`, so

 * repo's default branch (`resolveMergeBase`, `tui/utils/review.ts`).
 *
 * Branch config is the right home because git maintains it: the section is
 * deleted with the branch and renamed with a rename, so the record lives
 * exactly as long as the thing it describes and there is no cleanup of ours.
 *
 * A NAME is stored as one, deliberately — the merge-base still lands on the
 * fork point after the user merges the base back in, where a pinned sha would
 * drift. What must not survive is anything whose meaning depends on WHERE it
 * is evaluated, because this is read back from the worktree, where HEAD is
 * the branch's own tip: `HEAD` and `@` on a detached main checkout, `HEAD~1`
 * and `HEAD^`, `@{-1}`. Stored verbatim, the first two make the merge-base
 * the branch tip itself (a review of a fully committed worktree that reports
 * nothing to review), and the rest silently review the wrong range.
 *
 * So the value is what `--symbolic-full-name` NAMES the base, when that is a
 * real ref: `refs/heads/main` for `main`, and equally for `@{-1}` or
 * `main@{u}`, which name a ref here and something else, or nothing, in the
 * worktree. Everything git cannot name that way — a rev expression, a raw
 * sha, `HEAD` while detached (which names the literal `HEAD`) — is pinned to
 * its commit instead, and skipped when even that cannot be answered.
 *
 * Best-effort, like the exclude-file append: a config write that will not
 * take costs a later review its accuracy, not this caller their worktree.
