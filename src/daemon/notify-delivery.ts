/**
 * The daemon's `Notifier` deliver dependency: wraps `src/lib/notify.ts`'s
 * bare `deliver` with everything that needs daemon/session context the lib
 * module deliberately doesn't know about (per its own docs, it's
 * dependency-free so the TUI could reuse it):
 *
 * - Resolves the backend fresh per delivery (config is read live) and probes
 *   each distinct backend once per daemon lifetime, per
 *   `notifications-plan.md`'s "Fail-open everywhere": a broken backend logs
 *   once and disables delivery for THAT backend for the rest of the daemon's
 *   run rather than retrying forever. Because the probe result is cached per
 *   backend (not globally), switching `notifications.backend` away from a
 *   broken one and back doesn't get stuck disabled, and a backend that was
 *   never tried gets its own fresh probe.
 * - For `terminal-notifier` only, enriches the payload with the click
 *   actions the plan's "Click-to-jump" section describes: `-sender` (the
 *   configurable icon), `-activate` (always the resolved terminal bundle id,
 *   regardless of icon setting), and `-execute` (jump to the session's pane,
 *   or - for background/unbound sessions with no pane - open the picker
 *   popup on the most-recently-active tmux client instead).
 * - For `dbus`, routes to a persistent `DbusNotifier` (created lazily on
 *   first use) instead of `src/lib/notify.ts`'s spawn-based `deliver` (which
 *   treats "dbus" as a no-op — it's connection-oriented, not spawn-oriented).
 *   A failed dbus probe falls back to resolving "notify-send" for that
 *   delivery rather than hard-disabling notifications on Linux, per the
 *   "Seamless backends" section of the plan. The click action runs
 *   in-process (no `sh -c` wrapper needed — we're already in the daemon):
 *   a bound session spawns `tmux switch-client`, a background/unbound one
 *   spawns `tmux display-popup`, mirroring `switch.ts`'s argv.
 *
 * Click actions for the spawn-based backends run in Notification Center's
 * minimal-PATH shell, so the built `-execute` command is wrapped as
 * `/bin/sh -c 'PATH=<daemon PATH> exec <abs binary> ...'`, capturing the
 * daemon's own PATH and resolved absolute binaries once at construction
 * time (see `createDeliverFn`'s `ccmuxPath`/`tmuxPath` params).
