 *    stopping at `$HOME` or the filesystem root (never scanning above the
 *    user's home directory). `$HOME`'s OWN `.git` is only honored when
 *    `cwd` IS `$HOME`; a strict descendant of `$HOME` stops at the home
 *    boundary WITHOUT probing it, so a `~/.git` dotfiles repo (someone ran
 *    a bare `git init` in their home) does not swallow every non-repo
 *    directory under home into one giant "home-basename" group.
 * 2. A `.git` DIRECTORY means the main checkout: project is that
 *    directory's own basename.
 * 3. A `.git` FILE (a worktree) contains `gitdir: <path>` pointing into
 *    `<main>/.git/worktrees/<name>`; the main root is derived by stripping
 *    that suffix. A relative `gitdir` path is resolved against the
 *    directory containing the `.git` file first. If the resolved path
 *    doesn't match the `/.git/worktrees/<name>` shape (e.g. a submodule's
 *    `.git/modules/<name>` gitdir), this falls back to the plain cwd
 *    basename rather than guessing a wrong repo root.
 * 4. If no `.git` is found (not a git repo), falls back to the cwd
 *    basename, matching prior behavior byte-for-byte for a repo root or a
 *    non-git directory.
 *
 * Results are memoized (see {@link DeriveProjectOptions.cache}) so the
 * filesystem walk runs at most once per unique cwd (this is called on
 * every session create/update and reconcile tick). The cache has no
 * invalidation; a cwd's git-repo identity is not expected to change for
 * the life of the daemon process.

 *   git reports a worktree;
 * - a worktree whose main repo was MOVED still has a `.git` file naming the
 *   old path, so this reports a `mainRepoRoot` that no longer exists, where
 *   git exits non-zero and the daemon reports nothing at all.
 *
