/**
 * Relocating a checkout's UNCOMMITTED work into a fresh worktree.
 *
 * This is the one ccmux operation that handles work git cannot get back: a
 * commit is recoverable from the reflog, an uncommitted edit is not. So the
 * ordering below is the feature, not an implementation detail, and every
 * failure path is written to end with the user's changes still REACHABLE —
 * which is a weaker and more honest claim than "put back". A restore can
 * itself fail (the checkout changed underneath the move), and the confirmation
 * failures around the push return before there is an entry this function can
 * name. Every one of those still leaves the work in the stash, and every one
 * of them says which situation the caller is in rather than implying the
 * cheerful one: `sourceRestored` and `stashSha` exist for exactly that.
 *
 * The whole sequence runs under a per-repository lock, because the stash stack
 * is shared by every worktree of a repo and reading a status another move has
 * already stashed away answers the wrong question. See {@link withMoveLock}.
 *
 * The sequence:
 *
 *   1. Refuse outright if the source has a merge/rebase/cherry-pick/revert or
 *      bisect in progress, or if there is nothing to move.
 *   2. `git stash push` in the source. This is what removes the changes, and
 *      it is also the backup: from here until step 6 the work lives in a stash
 *      entry that nothing deletes.
 *   3. Create the worktree (injected; see {@link CreateWorktree}). It must be
 *      a FRESH one — a worktree the engine merely opened is refused, because
 *      the rollback below removes what it made.
 *   4. `git stash apply` INTO the new worktree.
 *   5. Copy untracked files across when the mode asks for it.
 *   6. Only now drop the stash entry.
 *
 * Two deliberate choices make the failure paths safe:
 *
 * APPLY, THEN DROP — never `pop`. `pop` is apply-and-drop, so a partial apply
 * takes the backup with it. Applying leaves the entry untouched, which makes
 * step 6 the single commit point: before it, every failure can put the source
 * back exactly as it was; after it, the work is in the worktree.
 *
 * BY SHA, never by position. `stash@{0}` names whatever is on top RIGHT NOW,
 * and stashes are shared across every worktree of a repo, so a concurrent
 * `git stash push` (a person, or another agent in another pane) silently
 * renumbers them. The entry's SHA is captured immediately after the push and
 * every later reference re-resolves it, so this can only ever apply or drop
 * the entry it created.
 *
 * OURS ONLY, PROVEN BY THE REF MOVING AND BY A NONCE. `git stash push` exits
 * 0 having created NOTHING when the tree went clean between the status read
 * and the push ("No local changes to save"), so `refs/stash` is read before
 * AND after it: only a ref that MOVED proves this run created anything at
 * all. WHICH entry it created is a second question, and the message alone is
 * no answer to it, since an entry from an earlier run of this very function
 * carries the same one and a name is a substring of every longer name. So
 * each run mints a nonce into its message and finds its own entry by that,
 * wherever it has ended up in a stack every worktree of the repo pushes onto.
 * Recognising ours by what is on top and roughly what it is called instead
 * adopts somebody else's work and then, at step 6, drops it. See
 * {@link readStashRef} and {@link findStashByMarker}.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO `git reset --hard` on the source. `stash push`
 * already left it clean, so a reset would be redundant on the happy path and
 * destructive on any other: an agent working in that pane can create files in
 * the seconds this takes, and a reset would delete work this function never
 * stashed and cannot restore.
