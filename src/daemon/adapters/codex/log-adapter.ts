 * such outputs flipping (fail open, today's behavior) at the cost of not

 *
 * Its cost is known and bounded: it admits any output stamped up to 250ms

/**
 * Tool OUTPUT items are the only in-log signal that a permission wait
 * resolved: Codex fires no hook on approval (manual or via its automatic
 * approval reviewer), and outputs are flushed only after the gated tool
 * ran. Without this flip, nothing moves the session off the marker-written
 * `waiting` mid-turn, so the row stays waiting until end of turn. Request
 * items and token_count are deliberately NOT resolution evidence (they can
 * flush while the prompt is still up). A NEWER PermissionRequest still wins
 * in the cascade: its marker timestamp out-freshens this entry's
 * lastActivityAt.
 *
 * The recency gate: an output whose entry timestamp predates the wait's
 * establishment (`anchor.anchorMs`, minus `anchor.slackMs`) is a buffered
 * leftover from a PRIOR call, not resolution evidence, and must not flip.
 * The cascade alone is not enough protection here: it restores `waiting`
 * at the next tick, but the transient store write is enough to destroy
 * the delivered desktop notification. The notifier retracts the banner
 * the moment status leaves `waiting`, and the restore lands inside the 60s
 * renotify cooldown, so the banner is permanently lost while the prompt is
 * still up. A missing or malformed entry timestamp is not resolution
 * evidence while an anchor exists; only the unanchored case still fails
 * open and flips, as before.
 *
 * The anchor is two-tier (see `waitAnchor`) because of how this feed is
 * driven. Codex holds its rollout fd open, so `fs.watch` never reports its
 * appends: the file is stat-polled once a second. Under event-driven parsing
 * the failed ungated attempt's output in Codex's standard
 * sandbox-fail-then-escalate flow was parsed BEFORE the wait even existed
 * (~200ms parse latency), so `prev.status` wasn't waiting and no flip was
 * possible. At 1s polling that same output is parsed AFTER the wait is
 * established, and it sits comfortably inside the 2s `statusChangedAt`
 * slack — it would spuriously clear the wait and destroy the banner.
 * Anchoring on the marker's own `state_timestamp` (`prev.waitEstablishedAt`)
 * fixes that: it is the request time itself, with no observation lag, so it
 * needs only a 250ms jitter slack. It also fixes the waiting->waiting case,
 * since the marker restamps on every request while `statusChangedAt` only
 * moves on a status edge.
 *
 * The flip is otherwise deliberately uncorrelated with the call that
 * established the wait, because no correlation key exists: the
 * PermissionRequest payload carries no call_id (verified on codex-cli
 * 0.146.0; it has session/turn ids, tool_name, and tool_input only), and
 * command-string matching is ambiguous in Codex's standard
 * sandbox-fail-then-escalate flow, which reuses the identical command
 * across the ungated attempt and the gated retry. The one known gap: an
 * unrelated PARALLEL tool's output flushing mid-wait is genuinely newer
 * than the wait and still clears it early.
