 *
 * Platform notes (verified on macOS):
 * - Event names are unreliable (`rename` for creates, appends, AND
 *   deletes), so events are classified by stat + a known-files set, never
 *   by event type.
 * - A file created moments after its parent directory only surfaces as
 *   the directory's event, so a directory event triggers a subtree walk
 *   that emits `add` for any unknown files.
 * - Deleting a directory may not emit per-child events, so an ENOENT on a
