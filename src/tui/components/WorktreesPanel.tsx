/**
 * The picker's Worktrees surface (issue #102), which grew out of the
 * prune-only dialog of issue #68.
 *
 * It still owns its own state and keyboard handling rather than pushing
 * either into the store: everything here is scoped to one open/close cycle,
 * and App.tsx simply stops handling keys while it is up (the same shape the
 * help overlay uses).
 *
 * Two things about the shape are load-bearing:
 *
 * - The read is TWO requests, not one. `GET /worktrees` is local-only and
 *   answers instantly; `GET /worktrees/prune-candidates` fetches and asks
 *   GitHub, and can take seconds. They are fired together and merged by path
 *   as they land, so the panel paints the list first and gains its
 *   classification afterwards rather than showing a spinner for both.
 * - Removal is still three explicit steps — pick, then opt in to anything
 *   dirty, then confirm — because the action deletes directories and
 *   branches. Nothing is pre-selected, and a dirty row needs its own `D` on
 *   top of being selected. The daemon enforces the same dirty gate
 *   independently, so this is the ergonomic half of the rule, not the whole
 *   of it.
