/**
 * The source picker (issue #151): one filterable list of a repo's open pull
 * requests and open issues, whose only verb is Enter.
 *
 * It is the SOURCE SELECTOR for a spawn, in the daemon's own vocabulary
 * (`gh-spawn-source.ts`). Pick a row and the existing new-session dialog
 * opens in the matching mode to cut a worktree and start an agent in it; pick
 * one already checked out and it jumps to the checkout instead. It is not a
 * survey — that is the Worktrees panel's PR view — and it renders nothing
 * that view does not already know how to render.
 *
 * Both sources share ONE list rather than two tabs, and the filter is why:
 * typing `notif` should reach a PR and an issue at once, because a user
 * remembers the words and not whether the thing they remember was filed as
 * one or the other. A tab boundary would answer a question nobody asked, and
 * a match on the far side of it would read as "nothing matches".
 *
 * The surface opens in NAV mode and `/` starts the filter, rather than being
 * permanently in search mode. That is a deliberate reversal of the first
 * design: one key means one thing on every surface here, so `j`/`k` move and
 * `q` closes exactly as they do in the panel and the picker.
 *
 * The filter row follows the session picker's search row exactly, down to
 * Esc: it is DRAWN only while filtering, and leaving clears what was typed
 * (`exitSearchMode` in `store.ts`). Those two halves are one decision. A row
 * that hid while the query stayed applied would leave a list narrowed to
 * three of forty with nothing on screen saying why.
