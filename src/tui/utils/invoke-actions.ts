 * `POST /invoke/:id/cancel` — the invoker's unwind tears down its session
 * (if any). A subprocess invoke row has no real tmux session at all, so
 * `POST /sessions/:id/kill` would 404; a Claude invoke's session must
 * unwind through the invoker rather than have its pane yanked. Crucially
 * the cancel always targets `originInvocationId`, never the row `id` (for a
 * subprocess row they're equal, but for a Claude invoke the row id is the
 * native session id, which is NOT the invocation id).
 *
 * Everything else kills the tmux session as before.
