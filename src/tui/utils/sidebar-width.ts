 * above; this wrapper only gathers their inputs and hands off. Propagated
 * resizes settle at the already-persisted width and no-op, so sidebars never
 * echo each other.
 *
 * Gathering is staged by cost: the local gates (prefs mtime, configured width)
 * run first, and a settle they reject while the prefs write is still fresh
 * skips the tmux query entirely. That arm is the propagation echo a fleet of
 * sidebars sees on every other sidebar's drag, and a propagated
 * `--apply-width` writes prefs before it resizes, so those echoes always
 * arrive inside the quiet period.
 *
 * Exactly one rejection still pays for the query: the no-op re-pin once the
 * prefs write has aged out. That one is the window-resize re-pin: the hook
 * resets the pane to the configured width, the no-op gate rejects, and a
 * skipped fetch would leave `lastWindowWidth` at the pre-resize value. The next
 * genuine drag would then look like it coincided with a window resize and be
 * refused. One fetch per real resize event keeps the baseline honest so a
 * re-pinned settle cannot eat the drag after it.
 *
 * The other two rejections skip the query: a degenerate width and a settle
 * arriving while a prefs write is in flight. Neither is an observation of a
 * window the user could be dragging in, so letting either consume the real
 * observation would leave the baseline claiming the window never changed, and
 * the artifact settle behind it would look like a genuine drag.
