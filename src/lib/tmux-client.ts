 * - The daemon's notification delivery wrapper (`src/daemon/notify-delivery.ts`)

 * tests stub `Bun.spawn` globally instead.

 * Deliberately not the pane's own tty: `#{client_tty}` is a CLIENT's device
 * (`/dev/ttys085`), while the pane runs on its own pty (`/dev/ttys079`), and
 * only the former is a valid `switch-client -c` target.
 *
 * NOT a promise that the answer belongs to the caller's session. tmux resolves
 * the current client with `cmd_find_best_client`, which prefers a client of
 * the resolved session but FALLS BACK to the most-recently-active client of
 * any session when that session has none attached. So a pane in a detached
 * session yields some other session's terminal, and anything that would MOVE
 * the returned client (`ccmux spawn`'s cross-session switch) has to verify
 * membership itself with {@link listTmuxClientTtys} — otherwise it yanks a
 * client that was never involved. Verified live on tmux 3.6a.
