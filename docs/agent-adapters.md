# Agent adapters

Per-agent hook/plugin quirks and the agent-owned files ccmux reads. **Read the relevant section before touching an adapter** — most of these are load-bearing workarounds for a specific agent's behavior, not incidental notes.

For the general hook flow (marker shape, per-agent pane-correlation strategy, install lifecycle, OpenCode aggregation), see [`docs/architecture.md#hook-lifecycle`](./architecture.md#hook-lifecycle). The single-source-of-truth adapter factory is `createBuiltinHookAdapters()` in `src/daemon/adapters/index.ts`, consumed by both the daemon and `ccmux setup`.

| :---------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Claude      | `adapters/claude/hook-adapter.ts`                                                                                                                                        |
| Codex       | `adapters/codex/hook-adapter.ts`, `hook-scripts.ts` (bash generators), `toml.ts` (hand-rolled `[features]` flag editor)                                                  |
| Cursor      | `adapters/cursor/hook-adapter.ts`, `hook-scripts.ts` (bash generators), `version.ts` (`cursor-agent --version` gate)                                                     |
| OpenCode    | `adapters/opencode/plugin-adapter.ts`, `plugin-script.ts` (install-time renderer), `aggregate.ts` (pure many→one fold), authored plugin `src/plugins/opencode/plugin.js` |
| Pi          | `adapters/pi/hook-adapter.ts`, `extension-script.ts` (install-time renderer), authored extension `src/plugins/pi/ccmux.js`                                               |
| Antigravity | `adapters/antigravity/hook-adapter.ts`, `hook-scripts.ts` (bash generators)                                                                                              |

The startup-race closer for markers written before the first scan created the pane-tracked session is the shared, agent-agnostic `reconcileSessionMarkerLinks()` in `adapters/link.ts` (keyed off `adapter.agentType`; it also re-derives native-id ownership each scan so a mis-linked id heals). Used by Cursor, OpenCode, Pi, and Antigravity (`Daemon.linkPiSessions` / `Daemon.linkAntigravitySessions`).

## Codex-specific caveats

- `PermissionRequest` requires Codex >= 0.122 (`rust-v0.122` / `@openai/codex@0.122.0-alpha.8+`). Older Codex silently ignores the entry because `HooksFile` does not use `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]`; `SessionStart` and `Stop` still work.
- `PermissionRequest` hook scripts MUST `exit 0` with empty stdout on every failure path. Codex interprets `exit 2 + stderr` as a `Deny` decision, which would silently block tool approvals.
- Codex 0.124+ renamed the feature flag from `[features] codex_hooks` to `[features] hooks` (stable, default-on by 0.130). ccmux's TOML helper recognizes either name; new installs write `codex_hooks = true` for backwards compat with older Codex, which is a harmless orphan key on 0.124+. Uninstall deliberately leaves whichever flag is present in place (see below).
- `SessionStart` fires on first user message in Codex 0.124+, not on agent launch. Sessions appear pane-tracked (no `nativeSessionId`) until the user submits their first turn; this is expected. Codex 0.122/0.123 fire `SessionStart` on launch.
- `ccmux setup --uninstall --agent codex` deliberately leaves the codex hooks feature flag in `~/.codex/config.toml` untouched (either `codex_hooks` or `hooks`, whichever is present). Orphan flag is cosmetic (empty `hooks.json` = zero handlers fire); flipping it off would be a footgun for users who enabled it independently.
- Codex's unanchored `processMatch` (`/\bcodex\b/i`) also matches the bundled computer-use MCP server (argv[0] basename `Codex`), which runs with its cwd inside `<CODEX_DIR>/plugins/`. `discoverAgentProcesses` drops any discovered process whose resolved cwd is under `<CODEX_DIR>/plugins/` (`isCodexPluginHostCwd` in `processes.ts`), so the plugin host never becomes a session. Without it the host would group by its version dir (e.g. "1.0.793"), collapsing unrelated panes. The filter targets the process (by cwd), not a session, so a real `codex` sharing the pane still populates the session with its own repo cwd.

## Cursor-specific caveats

- Hooks require `cursor-agent` >= 2026.1.16 (the hooks feature landed in that release). Older versions silently ignore `hooks.json` entries; `install()` warns but doesn't block, and `describeInstallAnomalies()` surfaces the same warning at daemon startup. Version gate lives in `adapters/cursor/version.ts`.
- `processMatch: /^(cursor-agent|agent)$/i` matches both the stock binary and the bare `agent` shim Cursor ships. Anchored on argv[0] basename via `findAgentForProcess`, so it won't collide with arbitrary shell commands that include the word "agent".
- `--resume <chatId>` accepts the payload's `conversation_id` (which equals `session_id` in every captured payload). Cursor scopes chats per workspace — `cursor-agent --resume <id>` only restores the transcript when invoked from the original `workspace_roots` directory. ccmux resumes inside the pane's own shell, which preserves cwd, so this is fine in practice.
- Cursor invokes hook commands through a `/bin/zsh -c` wrapper, so `$PPID` inside the script is a transient shell, not cursor-agent. The scripts walk the process ancestry via `ps -o comm=` to find the real cursor-agent PID; if the walk fails they fall back to `$PPID` so the marker self-cleans on the next scan rather than silently no-opping.
- `--resume` does NOT fire `sessionStart`; only `beforeSubmitPrompt` fires on the first submission in a resumed chat. The `ccmux-before-submit-prompt.sh` and `ccmux-stop.sh` scripts therefore create the marker if missing (same identity fields `sessionStart` would have written), otherwise resumed chats would be invisible to ccmux.
- Hook scripts MUST `exit 0` with empty stdout on every failure path. Cursor treats `exit 2 + stderr` as a "deny the action" signal. The four subscribed events don't gate execution today, but keeping the contract uniform prevents surprises if we later add `preToolUse`.
- `ccmux setup --uninstall --agent cursor` removes only entries whose `command` matches the exact install-written script paths, and preserves the top-level `version` field so a user's hand-authored `hooks.json` structure stays intact.

## OpenCode-specific caveats

- The OpenCode adapter installs a single JS plugin at `~/.config/opencode/plugin/ccmux.js` (OpenCode auto-discovery). The plugin authors are careful to use only `node:fs/promises` so the same file runs under both Bun and Node, whichever OpenCode was launched with. The first line is a sentinel (`// ccmux-plugin v<version>`); `install()` refuses to overwrite any same-named file missing the sentinel, and `uninstall()` refuses to delete anything lacking it.
- One OpenCode server can host many sessions. The plugin writes one marker per server-side session; the adapter folds all markers sharing a server PID into the single ccmux Session for the hosting tmux pane. Status is worst-of (waiting > working > idle); `attentionType`, `pendingTool`, `cwd`, and `nativeSessionId` follow the newest-activity or newest-waiting marker.
- Pane correlation uses PID ancestry (`HookManagerContext.getPaneHostingPid`) because OpenCode markers carry no TTY (no per-session TTY exists). OpenCode launched outside a tmux pane is out of scope.
- When all sessions on a live server are deleted, the adapter resets the ccmux Session's status to idle but the stale `nativeSessionId` remains (the `SessionManager` setter accepts only strings, not null). Inert: status shows idle, click-through still lands in the pane. PID death clears it via `cleanupStaleSessions`.
- `ccmux setup --uninstall --agent opencode` only unlinks the plugin file; the daemon's next `cleanupStaleMarkers` sweep removes any leftover markers when their server PIDs die.
- The JS SDK does not expose `permission.list`. If ccmux is installed while OpenCode is already waiting on a tool approval, the pending permission is invisible until the user responds or a new `permission.asked` fires.

## Pi-specific caveats

- Pi sets `process.title = "pi"` at the top of its CLI entrypoint, so `ps` reports the process as `pi` (not `node .../cli.js`). `processMatch` is anchored `/^pi$/i` (not `\bpi\b`) because "pi" is a short, collision-prone token; a `pi-coding-agent/dist/cli.js` `commandPatterns` entry covers the sub-millisecond window before the title is set and any platform where title rewriting doesn't reach `ps`.
- Pi has **no native tool-approval pause** (it runs tools immediately), so there is no authoritative `waiting`/`permission` state. The marker only ever carries `idle`/`working`, and the no-hooks `terminalRules` only detect `working` (keyed on the literal `Working...` / `Thinking...`; Pi's idle footer contains the word "interrupt", so unlike codex/gemini we must NOT key `working` on "interrupt"). A `waiting` indicator is only possible if the user installs a `tool_call`-gating extension, which is out of scope.
- Pi runs ONE session per process. A session switch (`/new`, `/resume`) emits `session_shutdown` for the old session (removing its marker), reloads extensions, then emits `session_start` for the new one, so markers never overlap and need no OpenCode-style aggregation.
- Pi auto-discovers both `*.ts` and `*.js` extensions (loaded via jiti), so ccmux installs a `.js` file. That keeps the authored template out of ccmux's own TypeScript build (mirrors the OpenCode plugin) while still being picked up by Pi.
- `ccmux invoke pi` shells `pi -p "<prompt>"` (print mode → final assistant text on stdout). `--session <id>` resume in print mode is unverified, so `resumeArgs` is not exposed (sessionId resume is rejected at the daemon, like gemini).

## Antigravity-specific caveats

- Antigravity CLI v1.1.1 exposes exactly five configurable hook events: `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PreInvocation`, `PostInvocation`, and `Stop`. It does not expose `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, or `PermissionRequest`. The first `PreInvocation` therefore creates the marker if it does not already exist; an untouched idle session remains pane-tracked until its first prompt.
- `PreToolUse` is a deny footgun. Its `decision` output key is required, and `{}` silently denies the tool call. ccmux installs only `PreInvocation` and `Stop`, where `{}` is inert, and never registers `PreToolUse` or `PostToolUse` handlers.
- Hooks run synchronously and block the agent loop, with a 30-second default timeout per handler. The ccmux scripts only read stdin, write one marker with tmp+rename, print `{}`, and exit 0.
- Antigravity v1.1.1 passes the full parent environment to hook commands, including `GEMINI_API_KEY`. Hook scripts must never print or log the environment. The ccmux scripts extract only the camelCase payload fields they need.
- The reliable global hook file is `~/.gemini/config/hooks.json`. Its top-level keys are named hooks; ccmux owns exactly the `ccmux` key and preserves every other key. Hook names dedupe across files with last-one-wins behavior, so another global or workspace hook named `ccmux` can shadow this entry.
- Workspace `.agents/hooks.json` discovery is unreliable in v1.1.1. Despite the embedded documentation claiming a repository-root walk, the file loads only when `--new-project` is passed on that specific invocation. A previously registered project is not enough, so ccmux installs into the global config file instead.
- Conversations are stored in SQLite, so Antigravity has no log adapter in v1. The per-conversation JSONL at `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/brain/<conversationId>/.system_generated/logs/transcript_full.jsonl` is a future log-adapter candidate.
- The `agy` name can also be a symlink to the desktop Antigravity.app launcher, whose resolved binary basename is `antigravity`. Process detection keys on the exact `agy` basename and the `/agy` command path form, so the desktop launcher is not treated as a CLI agent.
- `~/.gemini/google_accounts.json` remains `{"active": null}` even while the CLI is authenticated, so it is not an authentication signal.
- Each `agy` invocation writes a new `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/log/cli-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`. Hook execution appears there as `jsonhook__<name>_<Event>_<i>_<j>` activity. Headless `agy -p` invocations fire the same hooks, so they briefly create markers that the PID-liveness sweep removes after the process exits.
- The installed scripts write only `working` and `idle`. The adapter also maps `waiting_permission` for forward compatibility, but current permission attention comes from terminal rules matching `Requesting permission for:` or `Do you want to proceed?`. Those specific strings avoid misclassifying Antigravity's unrelated CSAT survey (`How's the CLI experience so far?`) as a permission prompt.
