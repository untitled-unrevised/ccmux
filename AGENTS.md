# AGENTS.md

## Project Overview

ccmux is a CLI tool for tracking AI coding agent sessions running in tmux panes and jumping to the one that needs you. It uses a background daemon that detects agent processes, watches log files, and scans terminal output to derive session state. An interactive TUI shows live session states at a glance.

**Built-in agents:** Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, Pi, oh-my-pi (omp), Antigravity, Copilot, Gemini CLI, plus custom agent definitions via config.

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime:** Bun 1.x
- **Language:** TypeScript 5.x
- **TUI Framework:** @opentui/solid 0.1.97 (Solid.js-based terminal UI)
- **Reactivity:** Solid.js 1.9
- **File Watching:** native recursive `fs.watch` for the agent log trees (`log-tree-watcher.ts`; chokidar fallback when recursive watching is unavailable), chokidar 4.x for the small flat dirs (markers, Claude subagents); stat-polling for agents that hold their log fd open (codex), whose appends `fs.watch` cannot see
- **CLI Framework:** Commander 14.x

## Development Guidelines

- Always use `bun` instead of `npm` for all package management and script execution
- Avoid `as any` type casts. Use proper types, generics, or `as unknown as T` only when source types have a genuine gap
- Use `ccmux show` to check session status and see active tmux panes
- You can run `tmux` and `ccmux` commands directly to test features end to end (e.g., `ccmux screen`, `ccmux send`, `ccmux spawn`, `tmux list-panes`, `tmux send-keys`)

### Verifying TUI changes

Typecheck and `bun test` verify code correctness, not rendering correctness. After any change touching TUI components, columns, layout, theming, or the daemon→TUI data path, you MUST launch the picker and/or sidebar and capture the output before declaring the work done. Non-rendering CLI commands (`ccmux show`, `ccmux config get/set`) do not exercise the renderer.

**Always test in a detached, isolated tmux session.** Do not launch the picker in a window/pane inside the user's active session.

Standard workflow:

```bash
# 1. Create a detached session with a forced, known viewport size
tmux new-session -d -s ccmux-verify -x 200 -y 50

# 2. Launch the TUI and let it render (use the same default tmux server
#    so the ccmux daemon can see real sessions; an isolated `-L` socket
#    would render an empty list unless you point a daemon at it too, see below)
tmux send-keys -t ccmux-verify 'ccmux picker' Enter   # or 'ccmux sidebar'
sleep 3
tmux capture-pane -t ccmux-verify -p | head -40

# 3. Resize / re-capture to test responsive breakpoints if relevant
tmux resize-window -t ccmux-verify -x 60 -y 30
sleep 1
tmux capture-pane -t ccmux-verify -p | head -20

# 4. Tear it all down
tmux kill-session -t ccmux-verify
```

Verify the specific area you changed: column alignment, active indicator (`▎`), agent colors, row collapse vs subtitle, sidebar layout, etc. If you can't reach the path you changed (e.g., needs a session in a specific state that doesn't currently exist), say so explicitly rather than claiming success.

**Fully isolated runs.** `CCMUX_TMUX_SOCKET` picks the tmux server a daemon tracks, so a test daemon can own its own server instead of sharing the developer's. Give it a distinct `CCMUX_PORT` as well (the daemon rewrites global tmux hooks, and two on one port fight over the same marker dir):

```bash
tmux -L ccmux-verify new-session -d -x 200 -y 50
CCMUX_TMUX_SOCKET=ccmux-verify CCMUX_PORT=2270 ccmux daemon start -b
# ... drive agents on -L ccmux-verify, then:
CCMUX_TMUX_SOCKET=ccmux-verify CCMUX_PORT=2270 ccmux daemon stop
tmux -L ccmux-verify kill-server
```

### Do Not

- Do not add new daemon modules without wiring them into `src/daemon/index.ts`
- Do not modify the SSE event protocol without updating both `src/daemon/server.ts` and `src/tui/utils/sse.ts`
- Do not add built-in agents without defining `terminalRules` for pane-tracked detection
- Do not register new `HookAdapter`s in `src/commands/setup.ts` and `src/daemon/index.ts` separately. Add them to `createBuiltinHookAdapters()` in `src/daemon/adapters/index.ts` — both call sites go through it
- Do not spawn `tmux` directly. Build the argv with `tmuxArgv`/`tmuxArgvFor` from `src/lib/tmux-exec.ts`, or `tmuxShellPrefix()` for a nested invocation inside a format-expanded shell body (`run-shell`, a hook) — a configured socket override reaches every call site through them and nowhere else

## Architecture

### Daemon

The daemon (`src/daemon/`) detects agent processes in tmux panes, watches log files, and scans terminal output. The key modules to orient by:

- **State Reconciler** (`state-reconciler.ts`) - Core loop reconciling native (hook-tracked) and pane-tracked sessions with live tmux state. The `background` tracking mode is owned solely by the Background Source and is excluded from every reconciler arm.
- **Cascade Evaluator** (`cascade-evaluator.ts`) - Pure freshest-wins-with-tiebreak fold over `CascadeSource[]` (marker, log, terminal). Tie-break `marker > log > terminal`; `upgradeOnly` sources can lift status to `waiting` but never downgrade. Used by both native and pane-tracked paths.
- **Status Machine** (`status-machine.ts`) - Derives session state from JSONL log entries.
- **Terminal Detector** (`terminal-detector.ts`) - Pattern-based status detection from pane content (agents without log parsing).
- **Binder** (`binder/`) - All session-to-pane matching policy: marker claims settle first (authoritative, re-asserted every scan), then heuristic assignment gated by direction skew, a 600s cap, and an ambiguity refusal.
- **Hook Manager** (`hook-manager.ts`) + **Hook Adapters** (`adapters/`) - Marker watching plus per-agent install/lifecycle/enrichment. `adapters/index.ts:createBuiltinHookAdapters()` is the single source of truth for both the daemon and `ccmux setup`.
- **Invocation Manager** (`invocation-manager.ts`) + **Invokers** (`invokers/`) - Drive `POST /invoke` / `ccmux invoke` (see [`docs/invoke.md`](docs/invoke.md)).
- **Session Ref** (`session-ref.ts`) - Pure resolver turning a human/agent session REFERENCE (id, `%pane`, `session:window.pane`, `self`, agent type, project name) into one session: exact tiers claim their syntax, fuzzy tiers are scoped by caller proximity, and ambiguity REFUSES with the candidate list.
- **Transcript Read** (`transcript-read.ts`) + **Readers** (`transcript-readers/`) - Read a session's last N turns from the agent's own transcript (all nine built-ins, tool output never inlined), behind `GET /sessions/:ref/transcript` and `ccmux last`.
- **Handoff** (`handoff.ts`) - The frozen provenance header plus the one-per-target queue behind `POST /handoff` / `ccmux handoff`: a peer's last response is composed daemon-side and only ever typed into an IDLE composer (working queues, waiting refuses, no `--force`). See [`docs/handoff.md`](docs/handoff.md).
- **Send Guards** (`send-guards.ts`) - The shared delivery-safety checks every path that types into a live agent pane runs (foreground liveness fail-closed, control-char strip, `unsafeReplyPattern` refusal, leading `/`/`!` defuse, `ambiguousWait`).
- **Server** (`server.ts`) - HTTP + SSE on port 2269: session CRUD, invoke endpoints, transcript/handoff endpoints, `/server-info`, PR enrichment.
- **Worktree Create** (`worktree-create.ts`) - Creates or opens the git worktree a spawn asks for: derives a name from `--worktree`'s value or the prompt's opening words, resolves the base ref, and applies the same file-setup conventions (`worktree.symlinkDirectories`, `.worktreeinclude`) Claude Code uses for its own worktrees. Also adds `**/.claude/worktrees/` to the hosting repo's `.git/info/exclude` (`ensureWorktreesExcluded`, idempotent via `check-ignore`), without which every later spawn sees the sibling checkouts as untracked work — the spawn handler calls it EARLY as well, because a move reads status before it creates anything. Per-repo locked so concurrent spawns don't race `git worktree add`. Drives `--worktree`/`--base` on `ccmux spawn` and the picker's worktree destination.
- **GH Spawn Source** (`gh-spawn-source.ts`) - Turns `ccmux spawn --pr <n>` / `--issue <n>` into a worktree spawn: the `gh pr view` / `gh issue view` lookups (injectable runner, 15s timeout), the `pull/<n>/head` fetch, the local-branch decision (reuse only a branch whose `branch.<b>.merge` AND `branch.<b>.remote` already say it is this PR (remote compared as a repository, a NAME resolved through `remote.<name>.url`), fast-forward only, never a force), the `gh pr checkout` tracking config plus `branch.<b>.ccmux-base`, and the seeded prompt. It also refuses a PR whose repo does not match `origin` (gh picks the repo, the fetch is hardcoded) and a head or base ref starting with `-`. Every pre-creation refusal is HTTP 400 with nothing created; a tracking-config write that fails after the worktree exists is a 500 through `setupFailure`, while the optional `ccmux-base` key rides back as a `warnings` entry on a successful spawn. Two rules it exists to keep: `preparePRBranch` releases the repo lock BEFORE `createWorktree` takes it (`withRepoLock` is not reentrant), and the seed prompt is never passed to `createWorktree`, which would prefer it over the derived name and rename the worktree.
- **Worktree Move Changes** (`worktree-move-changes.ts`) - Relocates a checkout's UNCOMMITTED work into a fresh worktree: stash, create (through an injected seam the spawn handler backs with Worktree Create), apply into the new checkout, then drop. Apply-then-drop, by-SHA references, and a stash entry proved ours by `refs/stash` MOVING and by a per-operation nonce in its message are what make every failure path end with the work still reachable — reachable, not necessarily restored: a restore can fail, and the result says so. The whole transaction is locked per repository (the stash stack is shared across a repo's worktrees), it refuses a worktree the engine merely opened (the rollback removes what it made), and there is deliberately no reset of the source. Drives `--with-changes`/`--untracked` on `ccmux spawn` and the picker's "Move changes".
- **Worktree Prune** (`worktree-prune.ts` + `worktree-git.ts` + `agent-state.ts`) - Classifies a repo's linked worktrees with a removal reason and runs the removal (directory, local branch, leftover pane, per-directory agent state). The read half is the only input the write half accepts; the endpoint (`server.ts`) is what re-derives it per request, so a caller can never name a path the scan did not itself classify as removable. What a caller DOES control is the scope that re-derivation runs over (`repo`, and an additive `cwd`), so a repo no session lives in is reachable — the gate is the classification, not the repo list. Prune is one action inside the picker's Worktrees panel (`W`), and the whole of `ccmux worktree prune`.
- **Worktree List** (`worktree-list.ts` + `worktree-git.ts`) - Every worktree a repo has, main checkout included, with branch, dirty counts, ahead/behind and attached sessions. LOCAL ONLY by contract (no fetch, no `gh`), because it is what the Worktrees panel paints instantly before the prune scan's slower classification merges in by path — which is also why it is a separate scan rather than a flag on Worktree Prune: absence of a removal reason is a FILTER there and a row here. Drives `GET /worktrees` and `ccmux worktree list`.
- **Background Source** (`sources/claude-background.ts`) - Sole owner of paneless Claude background-agent rows (`claude --bg`), read-only and independent of hooks/pane scanning.
- **Notifier** (`notifier.ts` + `notify-delivery.ts` + `notify-context.ts`) - Fires opt-in desktop notifications on `waiting`/`finished` transitions and delivers them down the backend ladder (macOS `ccmux-notifier` helper → osascript; Linux dbus → notify-send). Actionable Approve/Deny/Reply callbacks route through `notification-action.ts` (shared macOS-HTTP + Linux-D-Bus handler, all safety gating). The macOS helper app lives in `notifier/`.

Full daemon internals — the binder's D1/D2/D3 guards, the recursive log-tree watcher, PR enrichment, background agents, boot ordering, the invoke split, and a complete concern→path code map — live in [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md). Do not duplicate that detail here; keep this list to a one-line-per-module orientation.

### TUI

Built with @opentui/solid. Entry point: `src/tui/App.tsx` (key routing, dialogs) with reactive store in `src/tui/store.ts`. Components live in `src/tui/components/`. The surfaces with real internal machinery:

- **Row menus** (right-click, or `m` on the selected row) - Both paths go through one `openRowMenu` in `App.tsx` and must stay one thing; only the anchor and the starting highlight differ. Every `ContextMenuItem` carries a stable `id` because the list mutates under an open menu, and the pointer gets a snapshot where the keyboard stays reactive. Read [`docs/architecture.md#row-menus`](docs/architecture.md#row-menus) before touching them.
- **New-session dialog** (`n`, the row menus, or `F` for a fork) - Driven by `NEW_SESSION_FIELDS` in `store.ts` plus a `NewSessionDraft` key per field; six modes (spawn, Move changes, Fork, existing worktree, a worktree cut from a PR, and one cut for an ISSUE) policed by `NewSessionShape` and the policy functions; height is a BUDGET (`planDialogRows`), not a sum, and an unbudgeted row overlaps instead of clipping. Adding a field or a mode touches several places by design; read [`docs/architecture.md#new-session-dialog`](docs/architecture.md#new-session-dialog) first.
- **Source picker** (`N` in the picker/sidebar, `n` inside the Worktrees panel; `SourcePicker.tsx`) - One filterable list of a repo's open PRs AND open issues, whose only verb is Enter: it feeds the new-session dialog's PR and ISSUE modes, or goes to the checkout that already holds the row. One list rather than two tabs because the filter is the point (one word reaches both kinds); NAV mode by default with `/` for the filter; headers are lines the layout counts but the cursor never stops on. A PR is proved checked out by SHA and an issue by its ccmux-derived `issue-<n>` name, and that asymmetry is deliberate. Its two cursor effects are subtle in the same way and both have regression tests: the scroll effect must read every signal BEFORE its `listBox` guard (the ref is not reactive, so guarding first leaves a dependency-less effect Solid never re-runs, and the list silently stops scrolling), and the re-seed effect must HOLD a seeded key whose own source has not answered yet, since the three reads land independently. Read [`docs/architecture.md#source-picker`](docs/architecture.md#source-picker) before touching it.
- **Worktrees panel** (`W`, or the group context menu; `WorktreesPanel.tsx`) - Two VIEWS (`h`/`l`: Worktrees, Pull Requests) over a three-phase read: the local worktree list paints instantly, the prune scan merges in by path afterwards, and the repo's open PRs land in the second view, which is why the cursor is key-tracked (a PR row's key is synthetic) and scrolling is measured in visual lines. View and scope (`Tab`) are orthogonal axes, and the removal keys are gated on the view because `x` acts on the selection rather than on the cursor. Its row presentation and removal flow are load-bearing responses to live testing; read [`docs/architecture.md#worktrees-panel`](docs/architecture.md#worktrees-panel) before touching it.

Full TUI internals — the menus' anchor/highlight/snapshot rules, the dialog's field, mode, and row-budget machinery plus its wire behavior, and the Worktrees panel's scan, layout, presentation, and removal rules — live in [`docs/architecture.md#tui`](docs/architecture.md#tui). Do not duplicate that detail here; keep this list to a short orientation per surface.

### Data Flow

```
Agent processes/logs --> Watcher --> Parser --> Status Machine --> Session Manager --> HTTP/SSE --> TUI
         └── Terminal Detector ──┘    └── Hook Manager ──┘
```

### Session States

- `idle` - Not processing, waiting for input
- `working` - Processing (assistant thinking, tools running)
- `waiting` - Waiting for user input/permission (triggers attention indicator)

### Agent Definitions

Built-in agents: `src/lib/agents.ts`. Each `AgentDef` includes: `processMatch`, `commandPatterns`, `terminalRules`, `errorRules`, `executable`, `resumeCommand`, `promptCommand`, `forkCommand`, `sessionFilePattern`, `versionCommand`, `hooks`, `invokeMode`, `readyPattern`.

`promptCommand` (the interactive-with-initial-prompt shape used by `ccmux spawn --prompt`) is per-agent and non-obvious — `--prompt` means one-shot print mode for three of the built-ins. See [`docs/agent-adapters.md#spawning-with-an-initial-prompt`](docs/agent-adapters.md#spawning-with-an-initial-prompt) before adding or changing one.

`forkCommand` (branch a conversation into a new session, leaving the original alone) is Claude-only: for every other built-in, what a resume does to a still-running original is unverified, and a wrong guess damages the session the user asked to preserve. Do not add one without checking it live. See [`docs/agent-adapters.md#forking-a-session`](docs/agent-adapters.md#forking-a-session).

Custom agents via `agents` key in `~/.config/ccmux/ccmux.json` (types in `src/lib/preferences.ts` -> `AgentConfig`).

### Session Matching

For reliable multi-session matching, install hooks via `ccmux setup` (all agents detected on PATH) or `ccmux setup --agent <name>`. Currently supported: Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, Pi, oh-my-pi, Antigravity, and Copilot.

**Hook-driven flow:**

1. The agent fires its `SessionStart` hook (or, for OpenCode, the plugin reacts to a `session.created` bus event; for Pi and oh-my-pi, the extension reacts to a `session_start` lifecycle event; for Antigravity, the first `PreInvocation` creates the marker because no session-start event exists; for Copilot, the `sessionStart` hook fires), which writes a marker file to `~/.config/ccmux/session-pids/<agent_type>-<session_id>.json` via tmp+rename.
2. `HookManager`'s chokidar watcher observes the new marker and dispatches to the registered `HookAdapter.onMarkerAdded`.
3. The adapter finds the matching pane-tracked session (TTY-based for Codex, TTY match with PID fallback for Claude, PID-ancestry for OpenCode, Cursor, Pi, and oh-my-pi, and TTY match with PID fallback for Antigravity and Copilot) and enriches it with `nativeSessionId`, `logPath`, etc.
4. Per-turn signals (Claude `Notification`, Codex `Stop` / `PermissionRequest`, Cursor `beforeSubmitPrompt` / `stop`, OpenCode `session.status` / `permission.asked` / `permission.replied` / `question.asked` / `question.replied` / `question.rejected`, Pi `agent_start` / `agent_end` / `before_agent_start`, oh-my-pi the same three plus `tool_approval_requested` / `tool_approval_resolved`, Antigravity `PreInvocation` / `Stop`, Copilot `userPromptSubmitted` / `notification` / `agentStop`) refresh the marker's state. The reconciler then runs the `CascadeEvaluator` over the available sources (marker, log, terminal) and picks the freshest one, breaking ties as `marker > log > terminal`. This applies uniformly to native Claude/Codex and to pane-tracked sessions, so log-driven and marker-driven status converge through the same fold.

**Matching priority (binder policy):** Marker claims settle first and are authoritative (re-verified every scan, so a mis-bind heals). Panes markers don't claim are solved as a same-cwd optimal assignment gated by direction skew, a 600s tolerance cap, and an ambiguity refusal (a near-tie stays visibly unbound rather than guessing). See [`docs/architecture.md#session-to-pane-binding-the-binder`](docs/architecture.md#session-to-pane-binding-the-binder) for the full policy (D1/D2/D3 guards, boot-migration fallback).

**Note:** Claude Code does NOT keep session log files open, so lsof-based session file discovery won't work. This is why we use hooks for authoritative PID->Session mapping. For agents without hooks, detection relies on process matching + terminal pattern scanning.

**Per-agent hook caveats** (Codex feature-flag renames and the `PermissionRequest` version gate, Cursor's zsh-wrapper PID walk and version gate, OpenCode aggregation and the `permission.list` gap, Pi's `process.title` and no-approval-pause) live in [`docs/agent-adapters.md`](docs/agent-adapters.md). **Read the relevant section before touching an adapter** — most are load-bearing workarounds, not incidental notes.

## Key Patterns

### File Paths

Agent-owned files (logs, hooks, settings, sessions, per-agent install paths) are catalogued in [`docs/agent-adapters.md#file-paths`](docs/agent-adapters.md#file-paths). ccmux treats them as read-only except during `ccmux setup`.

ccmux-owned markers: `~/.config/ccmux/session-pids/<agent_type>-<session_id>.json` (written by hook scripts for Claude/Codex/Cursor/Antigravity/Copilot, the bundled plugin for OpenCode, or the bundled extensions for Pi and oh-my-pi; consumed by the daemon's `HookManager`).

### Column Configuration

TUI columns are configurable via `columns` and `breakpoints` in `~/.config/ccmux/ccmux.json`. Each column accepts a simple value or a responsive object with named breakpoint keys (`xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, per `BREAKPOINT_NAMES`) using mobile-first cascade. The default `row1.right` layout keys off `xs`.

- **Types**: `src/lib/preferences.ts` -- `Responsive<T>`, `ColumnConfig`, `BreakpointConfig`
- **Resolution**: `src/tui/components/session-columns.ts` -- `resolveColumns()` merges user overrides with responsive defaults

### Testing

**TUI component tests** use `testRender` from `@opentui/solid` (headless renderer, no real terminal I/O):

```typescript
import { testRender } from "@opentui/solid";

const setup = await testRender(() => <Component />, { width: 80, height: 3 });
await setup.renderOnce();
const frame = setup.captureCharFrame(); // rendered text as string
setup.renderer.destroy();               // always clean up in afterEach
```

- **Shared helpers**: `src/tui/components/test-helpers.tsx` provides `mockEnrichedSession()`, `mockSession()`, `emptySummary()`
- **TickContext**: Components using `useTick()` (SessionItem, Preview, GroupPreview) require wrapping with `TickContext.Provider`
- **Mocking tmux**: Preview tests use `mock.module()` from `bun:test` to mock `capturePane` before importing the component
- **Input simulation**: `createMockKeys` and `createSpy` from `@opentui/core/testing` for keyboard/callback tests
- **Fixed timestamps**: Use `"2024-01-15T12:00:00Z"` instead of `new Date()` to avoid time-dependent fragility

**Pure logic tests** (store, grouping, format, icons) use standard `bun:test` without `testRender`.
